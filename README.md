JEM 1.0 is an Arduino shield for 8 channels EEG (Electroencephalogram) firstly developed by Jacopo Oldani, Eugenio Demartini and Martino Migliavacca @YATTA! Makerspace in Milan. Niccolo' Leali contributed with the team during the test activity of the shield.


The project can be considered a fork of OpenBCI board (see http://openbci.com/ for further details). The main differences is that JEM 1.0 is a shield for Arduino board, i.e. it does not integrate Arduino "on-board", while it is an accessory for collecting information of brain activity. The project contributes to the community by offering:
1. the schematics data in EAGLE file (see JEM 1.0 - debug to complete the job... not a lot of effort is required actually :);
2. quite a few documents to get into the EEG world;
3. a set of data collected with JEM 1.0 shield that should help next contributors to participate to JEM project.
